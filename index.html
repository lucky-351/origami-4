<p><h3> Origami is derived from two Japanese words - Ori (folded) and Kami (paper).
    it was called Orikata (folded shape)
    The Japanese word for paper "kami" is the same written word as the Japanese word for spirit or god and certain origami...
    The Samurai in Japan gave each other gifts known as "noshi" that were paper folded...</h3></p>
